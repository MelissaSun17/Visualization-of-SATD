    Tab 3: The number of all SATDs and handled SATDs of the project over time,
    allow users to see time stamps referred to release or able to click data
    points to pull out SATDs on one release version. (you can show them in a
    time series graph that both of them continually increase over time but their
    distance increases and decreases over time. When their distance is zero, it
    means that in that time all SATDs were handled) It would be something like
    this but with two series not three.
